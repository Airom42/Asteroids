        <text id="intro1">Hello stranger. I am the Admiral of the United Earth Fleet Defense. You appear human, so I assume you are another survivor of Earth. Tell me, how did you arrive in this system?</text>
        <text id="intro2">My colony ship crashed in a system and I reconstructed space capable vessel, mined exomatter, and set out to explore the stars. I seek revenge for the bombardment.</text>
        <text id="intro3">Ah yes, the Calamari. We have seen no signs of them in this system. We also seek revenge, although our forces are somewhat... limited at the moment.</text>
        <text id="intro4">Since you are an outsider, we will be forced to confiscate your belongings until your prove your alligiance to this organization. We will provide you with a standard issue Battlesuit, and send you down to the planet to assist in defense.</text>
        <text id="uefd1">Like all suvivors, the UEFD fled Sol when they attacked.</text>
        <text id="uefd2">Our ships were damaged by a strange pulse on arrival, which rendered them useless.</text>
        <text id="uefd3">Since then, we have been trying to stay alive, fighting the natives here for survival.</text>
